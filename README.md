# Teleposter

This app is a completely independent wrapper made for Telegra.ph.

With this app it's very easy to create and share posts directly to Telegram.

These posts are marked with "Instant View" and are able to open "instantly" in Telegram. If you don't believe how fast that is, try yourself!

Telegra.ph is quite similar to Medium.com.
